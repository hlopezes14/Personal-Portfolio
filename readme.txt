--Readme document for Humberto Lopez Espitia--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

*/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- */1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
For basic features, I have included multiple images with descriptive alt attributes as explained in the lectures.
I have appropriate headings for text that need more of an emphasis and paragraph elements for body text. I also have various
links to external pages on both images and regular text using the "a" element. I have 3 pages that have appropriate navigation
using a header semantic HTML tag, as well as a footer semantic tag for my social media links.


(b) CSS features
I have modified padding and margins to make the content much more readable and pleasant to the eye. I have modified 
links, text color, and other colors to be much more appealing and used Bootstrap CSS helpes to create table like 
presentation with rows and columns. I have added a Menlo font as well and have appropriate fallbacks
if the current font would not work.


(c) Advanced features
I have created a hover a feature to all links and images used as links that change the x and y property of the 
links whenever it is hovered over. I have also used an online resource that allowed to change image color and link 
text color to change the filter to a limegreen color to give the website a Homebrew Terminal feel to it. I have also
embedded a Youtube Video for one of my projects and added multiple column and rows using Bootstrap.


3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
I would say this assignment took me about 15 hours to complete counting the time to plan what my webpage would look like
and looking for resources on my own.

5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
I didn't discuss this with any other individuals. I had somewhat of an idea on what theme color I was going for.
I was trying to have a Terminal-like feel to it but I felt like the green text would've been way too much to look at it.
So I figured that I could do black/white and I would just change the text color with the "hover" property. I even had the
same font as the Terminal does which is "Menlo."

6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
Hover over the text, it is not apparent at first but the text will turn green when hovered over.
I also did 3 sizes as my examples, which was iPhoneX screen, iPad, and MacBookPro screen.
